# dify-voicevox-tts

An experimental implementation of VOICEVOX text-to-speech custom model for Dify.

## 📦 Installation

Install directly from the [Dify Marketplace](https://marketplace.dify.ai/). 🚀

Or, choose the package version you need from the [Releases](https://github.com/uezo/dify-voicevox-tts/releases) page and upload it to your Dify instance, following the [official guide](https://docs.dify.ai/en/plugins/quick-start/install-plugins#local-file-upload).

## ✨ Add model

Set up VOICEVOX in the list of model providers. The URL must be reachable from the inside of the API container. `http://127.0.0.1:50021` doesn't work without any network configurations.
