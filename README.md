# dify-voicevox-tts

An experimental implementation of VOICEVOX text-to-speech custom model for Dify.

## 📦 Installation

If you want to install VOICEVOX plugin, download [dify-voicevox-tts.difypkg](https://github.com/yt-koike/dify-voicevox-tts/blob/main/) and upload it to your Dify.
If you don't know how, please refer https://docs.dify.ai/en/plugins/quick-start/install-plugins#local-file-upload.

## ✨ Add model

Set up VOICEVOX in the list of model providers. The URL must be reachable from the inside of the API container. `http://127.0.0.1:50021` doesn't work without any network configurations.
